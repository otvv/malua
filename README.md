<hr>

A simple CSS framework/UI toolkit designed to be used alongside a HTML/CSS renderer like Ultralight, Sciter or Electron. You can also use malua alongside another framework such as Express.JS, ASP.NET or in any web-environment.
malua was made to be used in gaming related projects, such as trainers and _**G**UIs_ _(using Electron, ASP.NET or a HTML Renderer of your choice.)_. malua can also be used for anything that you feel suited.

Malua was born with a simple premise, to replace <a href="https://github.com/otvv/fgui">FGUI</a> and to be a more versatile GUI framework, easier to customize and to build a menu/ui with it. But as the development progressed I've decided to turn malua into an UI framework/toolkit for people to build web apps with ease without the hassle of designing their own UI or dealing with native HTML elements. 

Malua still requires for you to use native HTML for some things such as handling page background, additional elements _(headers, footers, etc)_ and some other minor stuff such as linking widgets so you can actually use/handle them in JavaScript. If you know the basic of HTML5/JS you won't have any problems. After all, malua widgets are works just like any other HTML5 element.

For a few people malua might not be ideal since it is missing a few widgets for a full fledged GUI toolkit such as **TabPanels**. _(missing widgets are going to be implemented after release.)_

But for a web ui perspective malua works very well as you can see here: <a href="https://wallpaperize.vercel.app">wallpaperize!</a>
